Learning coding and how to use Github!

I've been working retail for the past five years, which I'm grateful for, but I've been wanting a change and am ready to do something to make those changes happen. I've developed an interest in computer technology and as time continued, I eventually found an interest in coding particular.

I have no business experience in the field of computers, so along side learning to code, I'm learning about what's out there. I'm learning about the people involved in the field, the nature of the business, the qualities that companies are looking for, and the many different expressions that coding can take. There's a lot to take in, and I hope to have a good grasp on the field over the next few years!
